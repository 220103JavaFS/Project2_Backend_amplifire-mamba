Project II
In this document, all rules and requirements on how to proceed about defining and implement the
Revature project II requirements are defined.
For this project, a different approach will be applied. You get to decide as a group, what are you
going to work on. However, certain rules and requirements must be met.
Project Definition
In the other document, you will find a skeleton where you should:
• Name it as following: PROJECT_NAME [scrum team name].
• Provide a project name and a brief description of your project (no more than four [4] lines).
• Define four (4) additional requirements on top of the mandatory ones.
o Note that there is one of the mandatory requirements that you have to modify.
After the document is approved, you can create a git repository or repositories to house the project.
(You may want separate repositories for the front and back ends.) Please ensure you invite your
manager to any repository holding project code.
The Project Definition should be done by the end of day this document is presented.
General Rules
• Groups shall be defined by the current Scrum teams.
• Each group should have their project’s Java backend in a working local pipeline. This does not
require using webhooks but does require building with Gradle.
• The project must be done completely. It must be clean, good looking, and user friendly.
• Have fun but keep it professional and think of this as your own product.
• Validation is important.
• Do not split work by layers. Work on requirements from front-to-back for full exposure in all
technologies.
• The application must be RESTful except for user login tracking.
Mandatory Technologies
• Angular
• Logback
• JUnit
• Jenkins Pipeline
• AWS RDS
• JSON
• Spring Boot
• Spring Data
